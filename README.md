# Insulin Calculator
This is a insulin dose calculator webapp live at []() using streamlit. 
This is a project that started when I was in Endocrinology. By that time I was learnig about DevOps concepts like CI/CD, so I decided to excercise them with a real world problem.

## Problem: 
Calculating the right dose of Inslin for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus commes with a set of challanges.

There are many variables to take into account:
- actual glycemia
- glycemia tendency
-
